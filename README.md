## About the project


zBrac<sup>1</sup>is a tool designed for easily modify the text of treatment files of z-Tree(Fischbacher,2007) treatment files.  With this software you can export specified text into "language files" import it back after the the text edit/translation.

zBrac is particularly useful when the tratment file contains same piece of text several times. This is very common as it is often needed to copy-paste stage tree elements in z-Tree.

## Design
### Keys
zBrac recognizes the text that are enclosed in double brackets: `[[This is a text]]`. Each piece of text that are double bracketed are called "**keys**".

Each key acts as a placeholder and later potentially to be replaced by another text.

To give an example, if you'd like to add a welcome message on your zTree file but you are not sure about the exact message at that point, you can just put `[[welcome message]]` on the appropriate place.

If your treatment file is already written, the 
sentences or text blocks to be translated should be enclosed by `[[` 
and `]]`. If you will write a zTree treatment from scratch, it is better 
to write all the text in double brackets. You can easily strip them out 
by using the *Strip Brackets* function of zBrac.

### Language files (xlsx)
A language file is an excel file which in each row contains a key as the first column, and a text to replace the key in the second column. For instance, once we have our welcome message, an excel file following the structure would allow us to replace the key:  

| (column1)  | (column2) |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [[welcome message]]| Welcome to our experiment |



### Treatment files (txt)
Treatment files (TXT): Treatment files are basically zTree treatment files in TXT. They can be exported/imported using zTree.

## Example: Translating Holt and Laury Measure

Here we demonstrate how to use zBrac by using a Holt & Laury Measure of Risk Aversion (Holt and Laury, 2002) from English to German.[2]

This is the english version we started with:

![zT-H&L-en](/visuals/img/png/zT-H&L-en.png)

First we enclosed all the text we want to modify with double brackets. The file now looks like this: 

![zT-H&L-zBrac](/visuals/img/png/zT-H&L-zBrac.png)

Then we exported the file to a text file by clicking: 
`File` then `Export` and `Treatment`.

The exported TXT files with brackets act like our master file. We can replace the values of the keys by using a treatment file.

We can either prepare a language file with the format described above, or we can generate a language file template by using relevant function of zBrac. We will do the second.  
We choose the `Create Language File` function and save the language file.

![zB-CL](/visuals/img/png/zB-CL.png)

This language file template now looks like this. In the first column it contains keys and in the second column it contains values that were generated by removing brackets from keys.:

![xlsx-en](/visuals/img/png/xlsx-en.png)

We create a german language file by translating the second column and keeping the first column of keys. We translate sentences to german and save the file.

Notice that the original zTree contains 40 duplicates the text "chance of winning" and with zBrac we modifiy that text only once. 

![xlsx-de](/visuals/img/png/xlsx-ge.png)

After that we were able to use the second function of zBrac `Implement 
Language File`.

![zB-IL](/visuals/img/png/zB-IL.png)

And for the translated language file.

![zB-IL-selected](/visuals/img/png/zB-IL-selected.png)

We clicked `Save treatment file as...` to create a translated version of 
our treatment file and save it.

![zB-save-treatment](/visuals/img/png/zB-save-treatment.png)

Finaly we went back to zTree and choose `File` and then `Import` and 
selected our translated treatment file.

![zT-select-import](/visuals/img/png/zT-select-import.png)

This is what our result looks like.

## Installation

### Installation with Windows Installer

You can download the installer here:

[zBrac-1-0-3-win32-setup.exe](https://github.com/seyhunsaral/zbrac/releases/download/v1.0.3/zBrac-1-0-3-win32-setup.exe)



### Installation with pip (Windows, GNU/Linux, MacOS)

If you have Python(>=3.6) and pip on your computer you can install with

`pip3 install zbrac` or `pip install zbrac`


Then `zbrac` command opens the software

It is pronounced ˈzibrək, like zebra (that's where the logo comes from)
