## About the project
zBrac is a tool designed for easy modification of the text in z-Tree treatment files. With zBrac, you can export specified text into *a language file* and import it back after the text modification or translation.

The main advantage of using zBrac for z-Tree experiment development is that that the text in zTree files can be modified easily at any time, which means the coding process and the text design/translation process can be independently done.

zBrac's design is specifically tailored for multicultural studies: By using the software, you can code your experiment once and send the original language file for translation. zBrac also tries to tackle encoding issues special characters in z-Tree by offering different encoding options.

zBrac is particularly useful when the treatment file contains the same piece of text several times. Such duplicate text is very common in z-Tree programming as it is often needed to copy-paste stage tree elements. zBrac recognizes each unique key as a single key and it would be enough to provide the text to replace for this key at once. For an example, please see below for the Holt and Laury measure example.

**zBrac is free/open-source software (See GNU GPL-3 Licence). You can use, modify and distribute it. It is not obligatory to cite the software, although it is highly appreciated. (see below about citing the paper) **

### Citing the software
Currently, a paper about zBrac is submitted to a scientific journal. If you use the software and would like to cite the paper, please visit this page or contact us before you share your manuscript to check the status of the paper.
